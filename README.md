A Flutter app for reading the "i am steve" web comic with offline support. Based on the Android version. Things missing from this one are:
- Different themes based on light/dark mode
- Fading edges on comic

In order to deploy it, set the following in "Edit Configurations":
- Dart entrypoint: ${YOUR_PATH_TO_PROJECT}\i_am_steve_flutter\lib\main_neocities.dart
- Additional run args: --no-sound-null-safety

Command to build autogenerated code:
flutter pub run build_runner build
