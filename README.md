A Flutter app for reading the "i am steve" web comic with offline support. Based on the Android version. Things missing from this one are:
- Different themes based on light/dark mode
- Build variants
- Fading edges on comic
- Disappearing arrows at the start and end of comic gallery

In order to deploy it, an additional run argument "--no-sound-null-safety" needs to be added in "Edit Configurations".
